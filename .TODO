            ☐ Create skeleton for new script, pass to client
            ☐ Create temporary id in script list for new script
            ☐ On recompile, check if saved id = id we created, if not, remove temporary id in list
            ☐ On close, if not saved, remove temporary id in list
        Decompile to source:
            ☐ Add option to decompile all scripts to source, and load source instead of from cache
        Ace Editor:
            ☐ Add better auto completion with argument completion as well
            ☐ Add better searching
            ☐ Fix issue with cursor not being 'text' cursor when hovering over editor
            ☐ Add syntax highlighting to words like 'component'
        References:
            ☐ Add 'get references' option to context menu in editor to get references of instruction/script
            ☐ Instructions, loops through all other scripts, if instruction exists, gets line of it?
            ☐ Script, loops through all other scripts, if call_cs2 with id exists, or anonymous class, gets line of it
            ☐ Add interface definitions and return references from hooks
        Component Definitions:
            ☐ Add separate UI for a basic component definitions editor
            ☐ Allow editing of hook scripts and their parameters
        Compiler:
            ☐ Clean up compiler, moving each statement evaluator to a new class extending CompilerNode
            ☐ Keep recurrsion throughout, and simply 'merge' the classes together when reaching the end of a block
            ☐ Once end of script is reached, there should only be one large CompilerNode
